# Overview

The reason that I wrote this application is to try myself at creating a working program that could request data from an API. Furthermore, creating this weather application also helped me keep myself up-to-date with my HTML and CSS programming. I was also able to integrate multiple web pages using a link that the user can click to switch between pages.

# Web Pages

My first web page is the main weather page where you can enter a city name and it will display the temperature, condition, and city name. The weather page will also change the icon of the weather condition if it is foggy or raining to the appropriate picture. The current date will also appear in the bottom right as whatever the date() function can find.
The second web page is an about page on what is being displayed on the weather page.

# Future Work

* I wanted to make a chatting app for the purpose of learning how to communicate online.
* I could try to figure out how to add more pictures of the current weather conditions.
